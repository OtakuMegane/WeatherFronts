#
# This is where we set up simulators
# Each simulator can optionally have settings added here that will override the defaults
# Anything setting not specified here will use the value in simulator-defaults.yml
#
# To add more simulators just create a new node with the simulator id (this cannot be easily changed once set)
# You can optionally give it a name that can be changed and will generally be used for display purposes
