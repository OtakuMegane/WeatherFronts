# Whether to use weighted lightning for larger storms
# The lightning values will be weighted by the front engine for a more consistent experience in larger fronts
# For example a player inside a front with setting of 10 will witness approximately 10 strikes per minute

# Precipitation intensity is the amount of precipitation from a front. Scale ranges from 1-100.
# At present it affects the rate of snow formation, cauldrons being filled, farmland hydration and optionally the light level
# An intensity of 10 is approximately the same as vanilla rain
# An intensity of 1 is 1/10th the precipitation of vanilla rain; intensity of 100 is 10x the precipitation
