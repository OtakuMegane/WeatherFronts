# This is where we create and name simulators
# It also contains optional simulator-specific overrides to the default settings
# Anything setting not specified here will use the value in defaults.yml
#
# To add more simulators just create a new node with the simulator name
# Then add the generate-fronts setting for the simulator (can be true or false)
# While not required it is recommended to also set at least the simulation-radius, simulation-center-x and simulation-center-z
# for each simulator. Otherwise they'll all go by the default size and center
